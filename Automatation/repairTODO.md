# RepairXML.java TODO

Functions to add:
- [x] tables in numeric list to grid - 'client-facing_interfaces.xml'
no caption, table -> grid frame = "all"
- [ ] turn RepairXML methods from static to class methods
- [ ] handle UTF-16 maybe bytecode
- [ ] too long: health_check, troubleshooting_g, UATS?, Demo?, etc.
- [ ] cut preforms that are too long (97+ char?)
